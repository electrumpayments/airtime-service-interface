This page describes changes to the Airtime Service Interface implemented across different releases of the interface.

## v5.24.0
Release 28 April 2021

- Increase length restriction on `Product.name` field from 40 characters to 120.

## v5.23.0

- Artefacts are now deployed directly to Soatype OSSRH as opposed to JCenter. The artefacts
  are signed with Electrum Payments' GPG key.

- Fixed `JsonProperty` for `ChannelProductListing.channelProductIdentifier`.
- Remove length restriction on `ChannelProductListing.channelProductIdentifier`.
- Added new `DescriptionAttribute` which is used in the `Product` to allow for descriptions for the product.

## v5.21.0 (Deprecated)

- Added support to filter by a `productCategory` in the `MsisdnLookup` operation.
- Extended the `ChannelProductListing` class to include a `channelProductIdentifier` which can be used to provide an identifier which is meaningful to the channel.
- Clarified expected values for `productType` field in the `MsisdnLookup` operation.

## v5.20.0
Released 18 November 2020

- Added a new `ErrorType` called `SYSTEM_MALFUNCTION`.
- Added a new `ErrorType` called `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.

## v5.19.0
Released 16 October 2020

- Added a new `ErrorType` called `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`.

## v5.18.0

Released 02 October 2020

- Added support for `LIST_PRODUCTS_REQUEST` as a request type in `ErrorDetail`.

## v5.17.0

Released 03 September 2020

- A new `products` resource has been added with a single GET operation. This new operation retrieves a list of products that are available for sale by client's channels. Unless a product catalogue is maintained, this operation will simply return a 501 HTTP status code.

## v5.16.0

Released 02 September 2020

- Added a new operation, `trialPurchase`, which mimics a conventional `purchase` operation with the following exceptions:
    - No voucher is returned and no product is applied to MSISDN.
    - Has no financial impact.

## v5.15.0

Released 26 August 2020

- This change affects the Java implementation of the API only and does not change the public definition of the API. The Java implementation has been updated as follows:
  - The following classes now implement the `HasAmounts` interface defined in the base API:
    - `MsisdnInfoResponse`
    - `PurchaseRequest`
    - `PurchaseResponse`
    - `VoucherRequest`
    - `VoucherResponse`
  - The following classes now implement the `HasPaymentMethods` interface defined in the base API:
    - `PurchaseRequest`
    - `VoucherRequest`

## v5.14.0

Released 07 August 2020

- Added new fields to the `Product` class:
    - `validityPeriod`: The length of time for which a product is valid. Any unused portion of a product (e.g. unused data) will be forfeit at the end of the validity period).
    - `productContents`: A list defining the contents of the airtime product.

- Added new models:
    - `ProductContent` which describes the content of the airtime product.
    - `ValidityPeriod` which describes the period before an airtime product expires.
    
## v5.13.3

Released 12 May 2020

- Fixed the `FULL_PATH` constants for `Vouchers` resource operations.
    - Note, this change is a breaking change for the Java implementation of the API provided by Electrum.
    - The following constants were corrected to no longer reference the `MSISDN` resource, and now reference the `Voucher` resource:
        - `VouchersResource.ConfirmVoucher.FULL_PATH`
        - `VouchersResource.ProvisionVoucher.FULL_PATH`
        - `VouchersResource.ReverseVoucher.FULL_PATH`

## v5.13.2

Released 28 November 2019

- Ensured Java 8 source compatibility

## v5.13.1 (Deprecated)

Deprecated, replaced with v5.13.2. This version was not Java 8 source compatible.

Released 27 November 2019

- Changed base service interface scope to provided.
- Re-added hibernate-validator dependency

## v5.13.0 (Deprecated)

Deprecated, replaced with v5.13.2. This version is contains incorrect dependencies.

Released 25 November 2019

- Update base service interface version to v3.23.0.
    - Added utility for serialising and deserialising JSON objects from a file.
- The Java implementation of the Airtime Service Interface is now built against OpenJDK 11 (with source compatibility for Java 8).
- Added new `ProductType` enumerations in the `Product` model.
    - `DATA_FIXED`
    - `DATA_VARIABLE`
- Added new boolean field `isDirectTopUp` to `Product`.

## v5.12.0

Released 13 March 2019

- Update base service interface version to v3.19.0.
  - Added new models:
      - `Pin` a base PIN model
      - `PinClear` for PINs in the clear
      - `PinEncrypted` for encrypted PIN blocks with the PIN block format, accountNumber and the key index
    - `Pin` was added to `CardPayment`, taking precedence over the existing `encryptedPin` field

## v5.11.0
 - Use v5.0.3 instead, this version contains broken resources.
Released 25 February 2019

- The `Product.name` field now allows all characters with only a length limitation. The maximum length limitation has been increased to 40.

## v5.10.0

Released 14 February 2019

- Corrected repetition of API base path.
  - *Note* This is breaking change to the API but is not treated as such. Previously the API defined paths to operations as `/airtime/v5/airtime/v5/{operation}` when they should have been of the more simple form `/airtime/v5/{operation}`. Changing the API base path in this manner would typically be a breaking change and would be reflected as such by bumping the major version number in the URL from `v5` to `v6`. However, all known projects depending on the Airtime Service Interface are already implemented using the simpler base path of `/airtime/v5/{operation}`. Thus the decision was made to transparently fix the base path repetition bug as a minor version update as this was deemed to be a less disruptive change to all known projects.
- Added new ErrorTypes:
  - `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`
  - `INVALID_CARD_NUMBER`
  - `CARD_EXPIRED`
  - `INCORRECT_PIN`
  - `PIN_ATTEMPTS_EXCEEDED`
- Added `RELATIVE_PATH` and `FULL_PATH` variables to the Java implementation of the API.

  - Added utility for serialising and deserialing JSON objects
  - Added `EncryptedPin` class
  - Added `CARD_HOLDER_INQUIRY` and `POINTS_INQUIRY` to `TranType`

## v5.1.0

  - Removed restriction on allowed characters from the terminalId property which means it now only has a max and min length restriction of 8.
  - Added an issuerReference property which adds a unique identifier to the customers slip.
  - Added a basketRef property which is used to group multiple transactions which would otherwise be considered independent.

- Breaking changes for provided implementation.
  - Remove incorrect calls to AsyncResponse.resume in resources classes.
  - Updated Airtime Service Interface abstract resource classes. The classes were changed to pass all parameters to the Implementor's custom resource implementation, as opposed to resuming the AsyncResponse from within the resource. The Implementor should now call resume on the AsyncResponse. This allows for more flexibility, proper asynchronicity and allows the user to choose their own threading model.
  - Added Jax RS Core Request to the expected parameters from @Context. This is passed through as above with the rest of the parameters.
  - Changed all advice responses to BasicAdvice from BasicAdviceResponse.
